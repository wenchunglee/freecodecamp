            <div class="move">
              <p>A<span class="first-line">da lovelace was a gifted mathematician, early computer pioneer and widely considered the first computer programmer.</span></p>
              <p>S<span class="first-line">he was the only legitimate child of Lord Baron and his wife. She was taught math and science from a young age which was very unusual for an aristocratic girl of the time. Her mother encouraged her pursuits in the hard sciences hoping to prevent her from developing her father's disposition.</span></p>
              <p>S<span class="first-line">he was mainly known for her work with Charles Babbage. Her notes on Babbage's proposed Analytical Engine contained what was considered the first published algorithm specifically written to be performed by a computer. Because of those contributions, she is considered the first programmer.</span></p>
              <p>S<span class="first-line">he died at the age of 36, the same age as her father. A programming language was named after her aptly called Ada.</span></p>
